### System Requirements

- MATLAB (tested with R2014a on 64-bit Linux)
- Caffe

### Installation

1. Download and unzip the project code.

2. Install Caffe. Please follow the [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) to install dependencies and then compile Caffe:

    ```
    # We call the root directory of the project code `WSL_ROOT`.
    cd $WSL_ROOT/caffe-wsl
    make all -j8
    make pycaffe
    make matcaffe
    ```

3. Download the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. Extract all the tars into one directory named `VOCdevkit`. It should have this basic structure: 

    ```
    $VOCdevkit/                           # development kit
    $VOCdevkit/VOCcode/                   # VOC utility code
    $VOCdevkit/VOC2007                    # image sets, annotations, etc.
    # ... and several other directories ...
    # Then create symlinks for the dataset:
    cd $WSL_ROOT/data
    ln -s $VOCdevkit VOCdevkit2007
    ```

4. Download the [pre-trained ImageNet model](http://dl.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/bvlc_reference_caffenet.caffemodel) and put it into `$WSL_ROOT/data/imagenet_models`.

5. Download the pre-computed EdgeBox proposals and put them into `$WSL_ROOT/data/edgebox_data`.

    - [voc_2007_test](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BynEQyOSGRoSbzhGbjM0RE5yNXM)

6. Install the project.

    ```
    cd $WSL_ROOT
    # Start MATLAB
    matlab
    >> startup
    ```

### Usage

You will need about 150GB of disk space free for the feature cache (which is stored in `$WSL_ROOT/cache` by default. The final adapted model will be stored in `$WSL_ROOT/output/default/voc_2007_trainval`.

1. Classification adaptation.

    ```
    >> prepare_for_cls_adapt
    cd $WSL_ROOT
    sh cls_adapt.sh
    ```

2. Class-specific proposal mining.

    ```
    >> maskout
    ```

3. MIL for confident proposal mining.

    ```
    >> mil
    ```

4. Detection adaptation.

    ```
    >> prepare_for_det_adapt
    cd $WSL_ROOT
    sh det_adapt.sh
    ```

5. Evaluation.

    ```
    cd $WSL_ROOT
    sh test.sh
    ```
